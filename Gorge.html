     <p id="p0" class="main__text-description"> This activity was held in September. It was very fun, but it was a little dangereous. We climbed with the sports shoes for our safe. </p>
     <p class="main__text-description"> We can see the beautiful combination of foot of Mt. Hakusan and gorge. The water of gorge was very cold and I felt that "it was the coldest day in my life." </p>
